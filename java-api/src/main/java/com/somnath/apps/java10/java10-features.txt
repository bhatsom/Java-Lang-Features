API/Developer Enhancements:
---------------------------
1. Local Variable Type Inference
2. Unmodifiable Collections
    - copyOf()
    - toUnmodifiable*()
3. Optional*.orElseThrow()

JVM Level Improvements and Enhancements:
----------------------------------------
1. Performance Improvements
  - https://www.baeldung.com/java-10-performance-improvements
  - Parallel Full GC for G1
  - Application Class-Data Sharing
  - Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler

2. Container Awareness:
    JVMs are now aware of being run in a Docker container and will extract container-specific
configuration instead of querying the operating system itself – it applies to data like the
number of CPUs and total memory that have been allocated to the container.

3. Root Certificates
    The cacerts keystore, which was initially empty so far, is intended to contain a set of root
certificates that can be used to establish trust in the certificate chains used by various
security protocols. As a result, critical security components such as TLS didn’t work by
default under OpenJDK builds. With Java 10, Oracle has open-sourced the root certificates in
Oracle’s Java SE Root CA program in order to make OpenJDK builds more attractive to developers
and to reduce the differences between those builds and Oracle JDK builds.

Deprecations and Removals:
--------------------------
1. Command Line Options and Tools:
    Tool javah has been removed from Java 10 which generated C headers and source files which
    were required to implement native methods – now, javac -h can be used instead.

    Removed java -Xprofoption. The option was used to profile the running program and send
    profiling data to standard output. The user should now use jmap tool instead.

Time-Based Release Versioning
